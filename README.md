Project: Analysis of a Retail Store

1. Conducted in-depth analysis of a US retail store's dataset using Python libraries 
such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
This involved comprehensive data visualization and the examination of multiple data attributes.

2. Derived actionable insights from the analysis, which contributed to profit optimization.
Specifically, identified cost-saving opportunities by minimizing discounts in states with significant losses, ultimately boosting the store's profitability.
